## 1. Users

Who is this for? Name **one** primary user type and describe them in one or two sentences.
"Everyone" and "students" are not user types; "a first-year student looking for a study group for
one specific course" is.

- **Primary user:** `<who they are, what they are trying to do>`
- **Secondary user (optional):** `<for example, an admin>`

## 2. Problem

Two sentences: what the user struggles with today, and why existing options fall short.

`<problem statement>`

## 3. Success measures

Three measurable signals that would show the product works. Each one needs a number and a way to
check it.

| # | Measure | Target | How we check it |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | `<e.g., a new user creates their first study session>` | `<under 2 minutes>` | `<timed during the onboarding test>` |
| S2 | | | |
| S3 | | | |

## 4. Scope: MVP, vertical slice, and not building

**MVP** is the smallest set of stories that makes *this* product useful. It always includes the
account baseline (sign in with GitHub and Google, update profile, delete account) **plus** the
stories specific to your product.

- **MVP stories:** `<PRD-1, PRD-2, ...>` (listed in section 5)
- **Vertical slice:** `<the one MVP story you will polish end to end and test with Playwright>`
- **Not building (this term):** `<at least three things a reader might expect that you are deliberately leaving out>`

## 5. User stories and acceptance criteria

One row per MVP story. Each GitHub issue links to its story ID (`PRD-3`) and each story has at
least one acceptance criterion in **Given / When / Then** form that someone outside the team could
test.

| ID | Story | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| PRD-1 | As a `<user>`, I want to `<action>` so that `<benefit>`. | **Given** `<state>`, **when** `<action>`, **then** `<observable result>`. |
| PRD-2 | | |
| PRD-3 | | |
